Using the Ruby on Rails, write some code that can parse a
configuration file following the specifications below. Follow your
own best practices and coding/design principles.

Create application controller and routes to handle configuration file parsing into the model.
Do not use existing "complete" configuration parsing
  libraries/functions, we want to see how you would write the code
  to do this.
Use of core and stdlib functions/objects such as string
  manipulation, regular expressions, etc is ok.
We should be able to get the values of the config parameters in
  code, via their name. How this is done specifically is up to you.
Boolean-like config values (on/off, yes/no, true/false) should
  return real booleans: true/false.
Numeric config values should return real numerics: integers,
  doubles, etc
Ignore or error out on invalid config lines, your choice.
Please include a short example usage of your code so we can see
  how you call it/etc.

Valid config file:

# This is what a comment looks like, ignore it
# All these config lines are valid
host = test.com
server_id=55331
server_load_alarm=2.5
user= user
# comment can appear here as well
verbose =true
test_mode = on
debug_mode = off
log_file_path = /tmp/logfile.log
send_notifications = yes
